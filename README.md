### San Francisco Crimes
The main goal of this report is to illustrate the use of the dplyr package in R used for data manipulation and processing. ggplot2 library is used for data visualization. In addition, ggmap is used to create a map of the San Francisco crime sites. Two data sets are used for the analysis. One of the data set is used only to create the map. The other data set is used for data manipulation and visualization. The data set can be downloaded from [here](https://data.sfgov.org/Public-Safety/SFPD-Incidents-from-1-January-2003/tmnf-yvry)
